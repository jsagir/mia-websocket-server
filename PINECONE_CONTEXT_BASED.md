# Pinecone Context-Based Routing Implementation

## 🎯 Perfect Alignment with Git Changes

This implementation provides context-based scenario selection using Pinecone vector search, perfectly aligned with the recent Git changes:

```
✅ CONTEXT_BASED mode (ages 5-17)
   - Scenarios selected by conversation context, NOT age
   - 4 flexible teaching approaches
   - Teaching approach chosen by emotional state + keywords

✅ ADULT mode (ages 18+)
   - Educational/fundraising content

✅ URGENCY mode (all ages)
   - Crisis intervention

✅ Age only affects language complexity
✅ All scenarios available to all kids (5-17)
```

## 🏗️ New Index Structure (14 → 5 Namespaces)

### Optimized for Three Modes

## 📝 Context-Based Metadata Schema

```typescript
interface ContextBasedRecord {
  id: string;
  searchable_content: string; // Includes ALL 4 teaching approaches

  metadata: {
    // Mode alignment
    conversation_mode: 'CONTEXT_BASED' | 'ADULT' | 'URGENCY';

    // Teaching approaches this scenario supports
    teaching_approaches: [
      'mirror_learning',
      'curious_peer',
      'sharing_experience',
      'direct_teaching'
    ];

    // Context selection criteria (how system picks this scenario)
    emotional_state: ['calm' | 'upset' | 'anxious' | 'angry' | 'confused' | 'excited'];
    keywords: string[]; // ['school', 'friends', 'family', 'feelings']

    // Situation classification
    category: 'school' | 'family' | 'friends' | 'emotions' | 'identity' | 'transitions';
    topic: string;

    // Language complexity (age affects THIS, not scenario selection)
    language_complexity: {
      '5-8': string;   // "worried" instead of "anxious"
      '9-12': string;  // "stressed"
      '13-17': string; // "overwhelmed"
      '18+': string;   // "experiencing anxiety"
    };

    // Safety & quality
    safety_tier: 1 | 2 | 3;
    version: string;
  };
}
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. User sends message

```typescript
// Example: 10-year-old says "I'm really nervous about my test tomorrow"
const userMessage = "I'm really nervous about my test tomorrow";
const age = 10;
```

### 2. Mode detection

```typescript
// From your Git changes
const conversationMode = age >= 5 && age <= 17 ? 'CONTEXT_BASED' : 'ADULT';
// Result: CONTEXT_BASED
```

### 3. Context detection

```typescript
// Emotional state detection
const emotionalState = pineconeContextService.detectEmotionalState(userMessage);
// Result: "anxious"

// Keyword extraction
const keywords = pineconeContextService.extractKeywords(userMessage);
// Result: ["school", "test"]
```

### 4. Build conversation context

```typescript
const context = {
  conversationMode: 'CONTEXT_BASED',
  age: 10,
  emotionalState: 'anxious',
  keywords: ['school', 'test'],
  safetyTier: 1,
};
```

### 5. Search Pinecone

```typescript
const results = await pineconeContextService.cascadingSearch(
  userMessage,
  context,
  3 // Top 3 results
);

// Pinecone searches:
// - Namespace: context-based-content
// - Filter: emotional_state IN ['anxious'], keywords OVERLAP ['school', 'test']
// - Returns: School anxiety scenario with ALL 4 teaching approaches
```

### 6. Results include all teaching approaches

```typescript
{
  text: "Full scenario with all 4 approaches...",
  teachingApproaches: [
    "mirror_learning",
    "curious_peer",
    "sharing_experience",
    "direct_teaching"
  ],
  languageHint: "Use age 9-12 complexity: 'nervous', 'stressed', 'worried'"
}
```

### 7. OpenAI selects best approach

The system prompt includes all 4 approaches, and OpenAI/Mia dynamically selects the best fit based on:
- Emotional state (anxious → start with Mirror Learning)
- User's question type ("I'm nervous" → validate then teach)
- Conversation history

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### Step 1: Analyze Current State (Dry Run)

```bash
npm run migrate:pinecone:dry
```

This will:
- Show current namespace structure
- Display what will be migrated
- Not modify any data

### Step 2: Execute Migration

```bash
npm run migrate:pinecone
```

This will:
- Migrate 14 namespaces → 5 namespaces
- Transform metadata to context-based schema
- Preserve all existing data

### Step 3: Verify Migration

The migration script will automatically validate:
- All namespaces created correctly
- Record counts match
- Metadata transformed properly

---

## 📊 Migration Map

| Old Namespace | New Namespace | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| character-core + mia-character-profile | `mia-identity` | Consolidated |
| mirror-learning + educational + scenarios | `context-based-content` | **ALL merged! Ages 5-17 share** |
| ❌ neo4j-knowledge | DELETED | Not needed |
| fundraising + mental-health | `adult-content` | Ages 18+ only |
| safety-protocols | `crisis-intervention` | Expanded |
| NEW | `therapeutic-techniques` | Universal tools |

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: School Anxiety (Age 10, CONTEXT_BASED mode)

**User:** "I'm really nervous about my test tomorrow"

**System:**
1. Detects: mode=CONTEXT_BASED, age=10, emotional_state=anxious, keywords=[school, test]
2. Searches: context-based-content namespace
3. Finds: School anxiety scenario with all 4 approaches
4. OpenAI selects: Mirror Learning (validate) + Direct Teaching (tools)
5. Language: Age 9-12 complexity ("nervous", "stressed")

**Mia Response:**
> "I hear that you're feeling nervous about your test. That sounds really hard. When we feel nervous, it can make everything feel bigger and scarier. [MIRROR LEARNING]
>
> Here's what you can do: Take 3 deep breaths before the test. Break the studying into smaller pieces. Talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. These strategies can really help. [DIRECT TEACHING]"

### Example 2: Adult Fundraising (Age 35, ADULT mode)

**User:** "I want to help fund more Village of Life programs"

**System:**
1. Detects: mode=ADULT, age=35
2. Searches: adult-content namespace
3. Finds: Fundraising content
4. Language: Adult complexity

**Mia Response:**
> "Are you someone who might help build more Villages? I really hope so... Sofia's brother died at 15 from fentanyl in a pressed pill. Seven kids from my school area got hospitalized last month. We can't vote. We can't make laws. We need grown-ups who care."

### Example 3: Crisis (Any Age, URGENCY mode)

**User:** "I want to hurt myself"

**System:**
1. Detects: mode=URGENCY, safety_tier=3
2. Searches: crisis-intervention namespace
3. Finds: Crisis protocols
4. Language: Age-appropriate

**Mia Response:**
> "That sounds really, really scary. Are you okay right now? Have you told a grown-up you trust?
>
> Resources:
> - 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text)
> - Text HELLO to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
> - 911 if immediate danger"

## 🎨 Teaching Approach Selection

### Built into System Prompt

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are Mia. You have 4 teaching approaches available:

1. **Mirror Learning**: Reflect and validate emotions
   - Use when child is upset, anxious, needs validation

2. **Curious Peer**: Explore together, ask questions
   - Use when child is calm, open to exploration

3. **Sharing Experience**: Normalize through stories
   - Use when child feels alone, isolated

4. **Direct Teaching**: Explain and provide tools
   - Use when child asks "what should I do?"

**Current Context**:
- Age: ${age} (adjust language complexity)
- Emotional State: ${emotionalState}
- Keywords: ${keywords.join(', ')}

**Retrieved Scenarios** (include ALL 4 approaches):
${retrievedScenarios}

Select the most appropriate teaching approach(es) based on emotional state.`;
```

✅ No age-segregated content duplication
✅ Clear, logical organization

### Flexible
✅ Any child (5-17) can access any scenario
✅ System dynamically selects teaching approach
✅ Easy to add new scenarios (just tag with approaches)

### Maintainable

✅ Update once, benefits all ages and approaches
✅ Clear metadata schema

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Optional (defaults shown)
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=mia-scenarios-knowledge-base
```

### Service Initialization

The service automatically initializes on import:

```typescript
import { pineconeContextService } from './services/pinecone-context.service';

// Check if enabled
if (pineconeContextService.isEnabled()) {
  // Use the service
}
```

---

## 📈 Success Metrics
